This is a placeholder for the Apple touch icon file.

To create a real Apple touch icon:
1. Use an image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, or an online tool.
2. Create a 180x180 pixel square image with your app logo.
3. Save as PNG with no transparency (Apple touch icons don't use transparency).
4. Replace this text file with your actual icon and rename it to remove the .txt extension.

For iOS requirements, this icon should be:
- 180x180 pixels
- PNG format without transparency
- No rounded corners (iOS will apply the rounding automatically)
- No drop shadows (iOS will apply effects)
