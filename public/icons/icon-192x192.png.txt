This is a placeholder for the 192x192 icon file.

To create a real icon:
1. Use an image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, or an online tool.
2. Create a 192x192 pixel square image with your app logo.
3. Save as PNG with transparency if needed.
4. Replace this text file with your actual icon and rename it to remove the .txt extension.

For PWA requirements, this icon should be:
- 192x192 pixels
- PNG format with transparency if needed
- Visually clear at small sizes
